Example API Call for registering Vehicle

- Call http://localhost:6634/api/Vehicles/registerVehicleAsync
		with a POST body of JSON data:
			{
				"RegistrationNo": "abc1234",
				"Make": "Toyota",
				"Model": "Giga",
				"StartingOdometer": 123000,
				"CurrentOdometer":123500,
				"CompanyId": 1
			}
			
-  This accesses the registerVehicleAsync method in the VehicleController.cs class in WebAPI
-  After converting the incoming request into a Vehicle object the registerVehicle method of the same class is called.
   A VehicleAppService object is created (Hubo.Application.Vehicles.DriverAppService) and it's RegisterVehicle method called
   
- The VehicleAppService passes the data off to the VehicleRepository object

- VehicleRepository does the magic, creating a HuboContext object with a matching VehicleSet object (holding the Vehicle object)
  adn the context then saves the data to the db by calling SaveChanges.
